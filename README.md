## Traffic Sign Detection OpenCV Image Processing

This project aims to detect traffic sign using traditional image processing methods and algorithms such as Canny Edge detection, color-based detection, shapes detection, Douglas-Peucker's algorithm. The results are satisfying, given the fact that the images contain noises, are bad quality, but image preprocessing (apllying filters, contrast enhancement), can make a major difference overall.

There are below expermiental results obtained by using the traffic sign detection pipeline.
